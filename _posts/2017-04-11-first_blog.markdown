I've been in the Air Force for nearly my entire adult life...  almost 17 years now.  Only a couple of weeks after having graduated high school, at the ripe young age of 17, I went to the Air Force Academy where I received my undergraduate degree and a commission in the Air Force.  At the time, all I wanted to be was a pilot.  So, I followed that track in life.

Now, many years later, I'm a husband and father.  The thrills of being a pilot and venturing off to the far corners of the world no longer compare with my desires to be at home with my family.  As a result, I've been looking to seperate from the military.  But where do I go from here?  My answer, was web development.

I took a Comp Sci core class in college where we dealt with Q-Basic.  I remember enjoying coding and the thrill of problem solving that came along with it.  Oddly enough, a military pilot's job does not center solely around flying an aircraft.  There's a substantial amount of paperwork involved.  To make life easier, I became (somewhat) proficient at using excel.  I enjoyed orking with methods and conditionals in excel making spreadsheats and trackers.  I've read articles about programmer lifestyles and pay, and began looking in to how to become a programmer.  I came across several reviews of Flatiron on decided to give the introduction to Swift course a shot.  Part way through the course, I was approached about applying for the Full Stack Web Developement Course and the Pi Day Scholarship.  A few weeks later, here I am!

I guess that's the "how" part of the answer.  The "why?"  Again, a lot of it has to do with lifestyle.  My wife is currently in the active duty Air Force, so we will be moving every three years or so.  These days, it seems every company, both big and small, needs a web developer.  Additionally, after building a portfolio, I imagine it be possible to work from home.  So the flexibility of the career is appealing to me.

However, I don't view this as a simple means to an end.  While income certainly plays a part in my decision to pursue a career in web development, I've learned that a paycheck isn't enough to get a person out of bed in the morning.  You have to enjoy what you do.  I love the challenge of coding.  The problem solving aspect excites me.  Working on a project until it functions and understanding WHY it works is fascinating to me.

Finally, the impact that developers can have on society seems boundless.  Being a part (even a small one) of that seems like a noble cause.

Thanks for reading!
