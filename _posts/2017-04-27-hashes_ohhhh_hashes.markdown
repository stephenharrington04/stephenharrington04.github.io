I just want to start out this blog with a quick vent sesh...  the Learn IDE is incredibly frustrating.  Constant disconnects, code disappearing after reconnecting, inability to connect...  It drives me nuts.

Aside from just complaining about it, I find it really is detrimental to progressing in coding (and not just in the sense that I can't move on to the next lab).  There's quite a distinction between understanding a concept enough to accomplish a task and being proficient at said task.

There are three basic ways that people learn: visually, aurally, and kinetically (rarely does a person just use one method, most people are a combination of two or more, but prefer one over there other).  I've found over the years that I'm a kinetic learner, meaning I learn best by doing.  This is from which most of my frustration is derived.  Let me learn, Learn IDE!

That being said, there is a way to set up a local environment...  here are instructions if you are reading this and have encountered similar problems: http://help.learn.co/workflow-tips/local-environment/setting-up-a-local-environment

ON TO HASHES!

Thus far in Ruby, I feel like I've had a pretty good understanding of concepts...  create a method?  No problem.  Iterate over an array?  Easy peasy.  But hashes...  oh, hashes.  Why have you forsaken me?

A little backstory...  I completed most of the free intro to Swift course on Flatiron prior to starting the Full Stack course.  I'm happy I did!  The course was incredibly in-depth with lots of practice labs and code-along type exercises.  However, the best part was learning the overarching concepts that exist in coding.  I was pleasantly surprised how similar Swift and Ruby are.  The biggest difference was only syntax and some difference in terminology.

Thus, I think that I've been able to progress through the syllabus quickly with relative ease.  Even hashes really aren't that bad.  In Swift they're called dictionaries, and I had a lot of practice with them.

But when we start getting into nested hashes and iterating over those nested hashes, life gets confusing.  There's sooooooo much information to keep track of and knowing where/how to delve into layers upon layers of hashes takes time and a lot of trial and error.  Additionally, the organization is tedious.  Ruby is supposed to be programmer friendly...  when you write the code, another programmer should be able to follow along with what youâ€™re doing easily.  But nested hashes look sloppy to me.  If anyone has found a good way of organizing their nested hashes, I'd love to see it.  What I've found that works best for my brain is to have a key on a line, then each individual value on its own line.

Finally, probably the best advice I have for working with nested hashes is use a pencil and pad of paper.  I've found that if I simply draw or map out what I want the hash to look like (a flow-chart type diagram is usually what I go with) on a scrap of paper, I can visualize the different components making up the hash and come up with ways of delving deep into a nested hash.
